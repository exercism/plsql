## PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language)

Is Oracle Corporation's procedural extension for SQL and the Oracle relational database. 

PL/SQL includes procedural language elements such as conditions and loops.
It allows declaration of constants and variables, procedures and functions, types and variables of those types, and triggers.
It can handle exceptions (runtime errors). 
Arrays are supported involving the use of PL/SQL collections. 
Implementations from version 8 of Oracle Database onwards have included features associated with object-orientation. 
One can create PL/SQL units such as procedures, functions, packages, types, and triggers, which are stored in the database for reuse by applications that use any of the Oracle Database programmatic interfaces.
